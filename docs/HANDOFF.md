## Status Summary

`KIM-382` is in progress on branch `feat/KIM-382-qr-activation-window`.

Already committed on branch:
- `lib/server/reservations-service.ts`: `CHECK_IN_LATE_MINUTES = 60` added, `GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES` 20→60, activation window now `min(start+60min, reservationEnd)` instead of `reservationEnd`
- `messages/en.json` + `messages/es.json`: `checkin.tooLate` updated to reference 60-minute window

Test suite optimisation in progress (NOT yet committed — working tree changes):
- `@vitest-environment node` added to 28 server/api/utils test files
- `__tests__/server/reservations-activation.test.ts` created (split from reservations-service.test.ts, 21 tests)
- `__tests__/server/reservations-service.test.ts` reduced (3 redundant update time-format tests removed, activation block removed → 67 tests)
- `vitest.config.mts`: `teardownTimeout: 10000` added

**BLOCKER: `__tests__/components/rooms/reservation-dialog.test.tsx` crashes with `ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED` even in isolation.**
This is the root cause of the non-zero exit on the full suite. Fix is pending — see test optimization plan below.

## Pending test optimisation plan (complete before opening PR)

Execute in this exact order — do NOT skip the find step:

### Step 1 — Full audit
```bash
find __tests__ -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.test.tsx" | sort
```
Review every file. Do not assume coverage from prior session.

### Step 2 — Add `@vitest-environment node` to remaining non-DOM files
Criterion: no `render`, `screen`, `userEvent`, no React component imports → node.
Confirmed pending candidates: `hooks/`, `lib/` (except `auth-context.test.tsx`), `app/middleware.test.ts`.

### Step 3 — `vitest.config.mts` final config
```typescript
pool: 'forks',
poolOptions: {
  forks: {
    execArgv: ['--max-old-space-size=4096'],
  },
},
teardownTimeout: 10000,
```

### Step 4 — `package.json`
```json
"test:coverage": "NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 vitest run --coverage"
```

### Step 5 — Fix `reservation-dialog.test.tsx`
Crashes with `ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED` even in isolation (505 lines, 13 tests, jsdom + userEvent).
Check: missing `vi.useFakeTimers()`, unresolved async operations, or heavy component imports leaking timers.
Likely fix: add `cleanup()` from `@testing-library/react` in `afterEach`, ensure all `waitFor` have explicit timeouts.

### Step 6 — Validation
```bash
pnpm test          # exit 0, all green
pnpm test:coverage # exit 0, no OOM
```

Plan source:
- Use only `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Ignore removed legacy planning docs and canceled legacy tickets.

## How to use this file

**At session start:**
1. Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` (this file) — mandatory before any action
2. Move the selected Linear issue to `In Progress` before writing code
3. `gh pr list --state open` — check PRs awaiting merge
4. `git branch --show-current` — confirm you are on `develop` unless active branch work has started
5. If operational closure is still pending, use the Manual QA checklist above
6. Otherwise branch fresh from `develop` for the next planned issue

**At session end:**
1. Update this file with current state
2. Do not add handoff-only state to GitHub comments or `CLAUDE.md`
3. Prune worktrees if needed: `git worktree prune && rm -rf .claude/worktrees/`
