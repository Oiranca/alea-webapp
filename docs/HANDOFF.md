## Status Summary

`develop` is current with `origin/develop` after merge of PR `#111`.

Merged product state now includes:
- admin-issued activation and recovery links
- DB-authoritative persisted auth/check-in timestamps
- explicit club-time helpers for reservation date-only logic
- timezone-safe reservation/check-in/cancellation comparisons
- Supabase migration split into one-statement files per repo policy

Current meaningful next steps:
- merge PR #114 (`KIM-380`) into `develop`
- next implementation: `KIM-381` (equipment-aware reservation flow)

Plan source:
- Use only `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Ignore removed legacy planning docs and canceled legacy tickets.

## How to use this file

**At session start:**
1. Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` (this file) — mandatory before any action
2. `gh pr list --state open` — check PRs awaiting merge
3. `git branch --show-current` — confirm you are on `develop` unless active branch work has started
4. If operational closure is still pending, use the Manual QA checklist above
5. Otherwise branch fresh from `develop` for the next planned issue

**At session end:**
1. Update this file with current state
2. Do not add handoff-only state to GitHub comments or `CLAUDE.md`
3. Prune worktrees if needed: `git worktree prune && rm -rf .claude/worktrees/`
