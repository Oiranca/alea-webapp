## Current branch
`feat/auto-cancel-grace-period`

## Open PR
[KimoxStudio/alea-webapp#76](https://github.com/KimoxStudio/alea-webapp/pull/76) — feat(M2): auto-cancel grace period constant + cron audit logging (KIM-327)
- Status: open, awaiting manual merge by user
- CI: ✅ typecheck, ✅ lint, ✅ 239 tests, ✅ build

## Issues in progress
| Issue | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| KIM-327 | Auto-cancel reservations not activated within 20-minute grace period | In Progress → mark Done after merge |

---

## M2 — What was implemented

- `export const GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES = 20` in `lib/server/reservations-service.ts` — shared by activation window and RPC call
- `cancelExpiredPendingReservations()` passes `{ grace_minutes: GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES }` to the RPC
- Migration `20260411000003`: parameterized SQL function + DROP of legacy 0-arg overload
- Structured audit logging in `/api/cron/cancel-pending` (success + error paths with sanitized error logging)
- 2 new error-path tests in `__tests__/app/api/cron/cancel-pending.test.ts`
- Test uses `GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES` constant for the RPC assertion
- Total: 239 tests passing

## Next milestone after M2 merge: M3 / M5 / M8 / M10 (all parallel-safe from develop)

**Any of these can start immediately — they do not depend on M2:**

- **M3** (KIM-330 + KIM-338): Overlap restriction per user — `feat/overlap-restriction`
- **M5** (KIM-331 + KIM-340): Cancellation cutoff backend — `feat/cancellation-cutoff`
- **M8** (KIM-332 + KIM-343): Events data model — `feat/events-schema`
- **M10** (KIM-322 + KIM-323): Auth hardening — `feat/auth-hardening`

After M2 merge, switch to `develop`, pull, then create the next branch.
