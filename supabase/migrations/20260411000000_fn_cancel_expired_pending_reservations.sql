-- Migration: add function to cancel pending reservations not activated within 20 minutes
--
-- start_time is stored as TIME NOT NULL in 'HH:MM:SS' format (e.g. '14:00:00').
-- Casting start_time::time gives a PostgreSQL TIME value which can be added to a DATE
-- to produce a TIMESTAMP. Adding the 20-minute grace period and comparing with NOW()
-- identifies reservations that should be marked as no_show.
